# üîê Back to the Roots: Nostalgic Journey to University CTF Battles of the Early 2010s

## üß† A Flashback to the Dawn of Competitive Hacking

The year is 2010. The world is recovering from the financial crisis, Apple‚Äôs iPhone 4 is redefining mobile technology, and in the dimly lit computer labs of universities across the globe, a different revolution is brewing‚Äîthe rise of **competitive cybersecurity capture-the-flag (CTF)** competitions.

I was there‚Äîa passionate student, fueled by endless cups of coffee, the thrill of the chase, and the dream of outsmarting a system. It was a time when hacking culture wasn't just about skill; it was about **camaraderie, curiosity, and crafting solutions** with limited resources but unlimited creativity.

Recently, I stumbled upon a treasure trove of memories‚Äîold code, challenge descriptions, and infrastructure setups from the CTF competitions I participated in with my team, **CrazY GeekS**. These weren't just games; they were battlegrounds where we honed our skills, learned from failures, and built the foundation of our careers in cybersecurity.

Today, I‚Äôm opening this time capsule and sharing it with the community. Whether you're a veteran who lived through these times or a newcomer curious about the roots of ethical hacking, there‚Äôs something here for you.

## ‚öîÔ∏è The Attack & Defence Era: Where Real-Time Strategy Met Hackery

Most modern CTFs focus on **jeopardy-style challenges** (solving standalone puzzles), but our competitions often featured the intense **Attack & Defence (A&D)** format . This was the real deal‚Äîa high-stakes simulation of real-world cybersecurity warfare.

*   **Your Team's Mission:** Protect your own vulnerable services (running on custom infrastructure) from being exploited by opposing teams while simultaneously attacking *their* systems to steal "flags" (specific pieces of data).
*   **The Infrastructure:** Our setups, meticulously documented in Markdown files now hosted on GitHub, were built on a shoestring budget. Think old desktop computers repurposed as servers, networked together in a lab, often running on **Linux distributions** that were considered cutting-edge at the time. Managing these systems taught us more about practical network administration and security hardening than any textbook could.
*   **The Challenges:** The vulnerabilities we planted and exploited were classics that are still relevant today: poorly sanitized inputs leading to **SQL injection (SQLi)** in web apps, buffer overflows in custom network services, misconfigured permissions, and cryptographic weaknesses . The key difference? We had to find and patch these flaws in our *own* services while everyone else was trying to exploit them‚Äîa brutal but incredibly effective learning process.

## üõ†Ô∏è The Tools of the Trade: A Different Time

Our toolkit in 2010 was vastly different from the standardized platforms available today.

*   **Kali Linux** predecessor, **BackTrack**, was the go-to penetration testing distribution for many .
*   **Web Vulnerability Scanners:** Tools like **Burp Suite** were already indispensable for probing web applications, but their features were far less automated than they are now . Manual testing and a deep understanding of HTTP protocols were paramount.
*   **Reverse Engineering:** For binary challenges, **OllyDbg** on Windows and **GDB** on Linux were our debuggers of choice. **IDA Pro** was the powerful (and expensive) disassembler we aspired to master .
*   **The Spirit of DIY:** Perhaps the most significant difference was the lack of managed platforms. Much of the infrastructure for the competitions‚Äîfrom the game master servers to the scoring engines‚Äîwas **built from scratch by the organizers and participating teams**. This forced us to understand the entire stack, from low-level networking to application logic.

## üì¶ What‚Äôs in the Archive? Sharing the Knowledge

I‚Äôve uploaded a curated collection from those days to a **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/D3One/CTF_CrazY_GeekS/tree/main/Attack%26Defence)**. It includes:

*   **Challenge Descriptions:** The original write-ups for various A&D tasks.
*   **Infrastructure Guides:** Documentation on how we set up the vulnerable services and networking for our practices and competitions.
*   **Scripts & Tools:** Custom scripts, patches, and configuration files used to deploy, secure, and attack services. These are historical artifacts that showcase the problem-solving approaches of the era.
*   **Tips & Tricks:** Notes and shared knowledge from our team, offering a glimpse into our thought processes.

This isn‚Äôt just a code dump; it‚Äôs a **piece of hacking history**. It‚Äôs for those who value the culture, the learning process, and the raw ingenuity that defined the early days of CTFs.

## ü§î Why Share This Now?

1.  **For the Nostalgia:** For those who were there, let‚Äôs take a moment to remember the late nights, the sudden breakthroughs, and the frustration of a service going down minutes before the end of a round.
2.  **For the New Generation:** To show that today‚Äôs polished CTF platforms and cloud infrastructure stand on the shoulders of these grassroots, DIY efforts. The core concepts‚Äî**critical thinking, persistence, and a deep understanding of systems**‚Äîhaven‚Äôt changed.
3.  **For My Story:** These competitions were a formative part of my journey into cybersecurity. They taught me strategic thinking, teamwork under pressure, and the ethics of responsible disclosure‚Äîlessons that continue to shape my professional path, including my recent work with **[Grow Cluster](https://growcluster.com/en/)**.

I encourage you to explore the repo, not necessarily for the technical answers (some of the exploits are undoubtedly outdated!), but for the **mindset and the methodology**. Try to understand *why* things were built the way they were. You might be surprised at how many principles remain timeless.
