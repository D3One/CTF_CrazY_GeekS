Challenge 2: Spot the Vuln - Web Edition

Description: Here's a snippet of a PHP login script from a web app circa 2010. Find at least TWO critical vulnerabilities.

<?php
    $user = $_GET['username'];
    $pass = $_GET['password'];
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$user' AND password='$pass'";
    $result = mysql_query($sql);
    if (mysql_num_rows($result) > 0) {
        echo "Access Granted!";
    } else {
        echo "Access Denied!";
    }
?>
Tools: Your brain. Theory: (1) Never trust user input. (2) SQL queries constructed by string concatenation are bad. (3) Passwords should not be stored in plaintext. Hint: One vuln is SQL Injection. The other is related to how the password is handled.
