Challenge 1: Patch the Buffer Overflow

Description: Here is the vulnerable code (vuln.c). It's a simple stack-based buffer overflow. Your task is not to exploit it, but to PATCH it. Fix the vulnerability using a safe function.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    char buffer[100];
    strcpy(buffer, argv[1]); // <-- VULNERABILITY
    printf("Input was: %s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
Tools: A text editor, gcc. Theory: strcpy() does not check bounds. Use a function that does, like strncpy(). Hint: Remember to manually null-terminate the string if you use strncpy.
