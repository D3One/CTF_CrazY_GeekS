# Cr@zY Geek$ Classic CTF Puzzles & Solutions (2010) 

This directory contains a collection of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and their detailed solutions, meticulously crafted by **D3One** in close collaboration with his professor and mentor, **Oleg Usenko**.

These puzzles are a tribute to the foundational years of competitive cybersecurity. They were not merely copied but designed from the ground up, drawing inspiration from the foundational texts of the time, various technical books, and, most importantly, the iconic articles found in the pages of the legendary **Xakep Magazine** (`–ñ—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª –•–∞–∫–µ—Ä`).

## üß† A Glimpse into the Past

Today, these challenges might seem straightforward to a modern practitioner armed with powerful tools and vast online resources. However, **fifteen years ago, this was the cutting edge.**

Solving these required:
*   **Ingenuity over Tooling:** Heavy reliance on built-in OS utilities (`debug.exe`, `arp`, `tcpdump`) as specialized frameworks were rare.
*   **Patience:** Slow internet meant researching a vulnerability could take hours, not a quick Google search.
*   **Deep System Understanding:** Concepts like NTFS Alternate Data Streams on **Windows XP** or SUID misconfigurations on early Linux kernels were novel and poorly documented.
*   **Physical Access Tactics:** Many puzzles assume physical access to a machine or network segment, a common scenario in early university lab-based CTFs.

This repository is a time capsule from an era of **Windows XP, Pentium 4 processors, DVD-based software distributions, and dial-up/modem connections.** It represents a true battle of wits and a foundational competition that shaped a generation of security professionals.

## üìÅ Contents

*   `Challenges/`: The complete list of puzzles, categorized by domain (Cryptography, Networking, Windows, Linux, etc.).
*   `Solutions/`: Detailed, step-by-step walkthroughs for every challenge, explaining the theory and tools required to solve them.
*   `Tools/` (Optional): A collection of period-accurate or helpful tools for solving the challenges (e.g., old versions of `debug`, `arpspoof`, etc.).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer & Educational Purpose

**These materials are provided for historical and educational purposes only.**

*   **Outdated Information:** The digital landscape has evolved tremendously since ~2010. Techniques, vulnerabilities, and default configurations described here are almost certainly **patched on modern systems.** Do not expect these exact exploits to work on any current, properly secured system.
*   **Legal & Ethical Use:** The information contained in this repository is intended to teach fundamental cybersecurity concepts in a controlled, academic environment. **Any attempt to use these techniques against systems without explicit prior authorization is illegal and unethical.**
*   **No Warranty:** All materials are provided "AS IS" without any warranty. **The entire risk of implementation or use is with you.**
