# Cr@zY Geek$ CTF team

The CrazY geek$ team was formed in 2009 by enthusiasts and then-students of the Information Security Department of the Engineering and Technology Institute of the Siberian Academy of Law, Economics, and Management (SALEM) in Irtutsk city. 
With the support of our programming team leader [Oleg Usenko](https://github.com/D3One/CTF_CrazY_GeekS/blob/main/The%20Persons.md) and Linux guru Yuri Nikolaevich Perelyaev.

CrazY geek$ became one of the first teams in the Siberian Federal District and the first [CTF](https://github.com/D3One/CTF_CrazY_GeekS/blob/main/CTF%20Basics.md) team in the city of Irkutsk to participate in competitions related to information security. 
The competitions were held according to classic rules and included various tasks: reversing, crypto, recon, exploit, information gathering, solving cases for Linux, programming, etc.

Of course, the format at that time was completely different from what it is now. However, it was the first step in this direction...  It was at that moment that the author of this blog became fascinated with reverse engineering and everything related to it.

At the university competitions held in 2010 among technical universities in Irkutsk, our team, CrazY geek$, took first place in the qualifying round and second place in the final.
