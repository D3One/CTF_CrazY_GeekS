Welcome to a time capsule from the early days of competitive cybersecurity! This repository archives the tasks, challenges, and solutions from the Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions I participated in back in **2009-2010** as a member of the **"CrazY GeekS"** university team.

These files represent a snapshot of the challenges that shaped a generation of security professionals. They are preserved here for historical interest, educational purposes, and a bit of nostalgic fun.

## üö© What is a CTF (Capture The Flag)?

A Capture The Flag (CTF) competition is a special kind of cybersecurity contest designed to test participants' skills in various computer security domains in a practical, hands-on way.

Think of it as a **sport for hackers** (the ethical kind!). Teams or individuals compete to solve security-oriented tasks and puzzles. Each solved task yields a secret string called a **"flag"**, which is submitted to the scoring server for points. The team with the most points wins.

CTFs are the primary training ground for developing the practical skills needed by modern cybersecurity experts.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Main CTF Formats

While modern CTFs have evolved, most competitions in the late 2000s fit into two primary formats:

### 1. Task-Based (Jeopardy-Style)
This is the most common format, especially for online qualifiers. It resembles a quiz show like Jeopardy.
*   **How it works:** A list of challenges from various categories is presented.
*   **The Goal:** Solve each challenge to find a hidden flag (e.g., `FLAG{Th1s_1s_4_Fl4g}`).
*   **Categories Include:**
    *   **Web Security:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in websites (SQL Injection, XSS).
    *   **Forensics:** Analyzing network packets (PCAP), disk images, or log files to find clues.
    *   **Cryptography:** Breaking weak encryption or deciphering encoded messages.
    *   **Reverse Engineering:** Taking apart compiled programs to understand their secret function.
    *   **Pwnable:** Exploiting binary vulnerabilities to gain remote code execution on a server.
    *   **Miscellaneous:** Puzzles, steganography (hiding data in images), and logic problems.

### 2. Attack-Defense
This is a more advanced and intense format, often used in later stages of major competitions.
*   **How it works:** Each team is given an identical server or network to defend, which contains intentionally vulnerable services.
*   **The Goal:**
    1.  **Defend:** Patch and secure your own services to prevent other teams from attacking them.
    2.  **Attack:** Find vulnerabilities in the other teams' services and exploit them to steal "flags" from their servers.
*   **The Challenge:** It's a constant balance between spending time fixing your own services and hacking everyone else's. This format most closely simulates real-world network warfare.

## üìú A Brief History of CTFs

The concept of CTFs is deeply rooted in the hacker culture of the 1990s.
*   **The Origin:** The first-ever CTF is widely attributed to the event held at **DEF CON 4** in **1996**. It was a simple attack-defense game played on a isolated network.
*   **Early Evolution:** These early events were chaotic and often based on ad-hoc rules. The **"Jeopardy-Style"** format was popularized later to make competitions more accessible and scalable for larger online audiences.
*   **The University Movement:** By the mid-2000s, CTFs had become a cornerstone of cybersecurity education at universities worldwide. They provided a legal and controlled environment for students to apply theoretical knowledge, fostering skills in vulnerability discovery, exploit development, and incident response. The competitions archived in this repository are a part of that seminal university movement.

## üéì CTFs and Cybersecurity Education

CTFs are not just games; they are a critical pedagogical tool. For students specializing in **"Cybersecurity"** or **"Information Security,"** participation in CTFs offers unparalleled benefits:

*   **Practical Application:** Translates theoretical knowledge from lectures into real-world skills.
*   **Problem-Solving Mindset:** Teaches a methodical approach to analyzing complex systems and thinking like an attacker.
*   **Teamwork & Communication:** Requires collaboration between experts in different domains (e.g., a reverse engineer working with a cryptographer).
*   **Building a Portfolio:** Success in CTFs is a respected accolade that can significantly boost a resume and help launch a career in security engineering, penetration testing, or threat intelligence.

The skills honed in these competitions are directly applicable to roles like **Security Analyst, Penetration Tester, Incident Responder, and Malware Researcher.**

## üìÅ About This Repository

This repo contains challenges and write-ups from the **2009/2010** season. The tasks reflect the state of cybersecurity art from that era. You'll find challenges related to:
*   Classic web vulnerabilities (e.g., PHP includes, early SQLi).
*   Cryptography puzzles with now-outdated algorithms.
*   Forensics tasks with older file formats and protocols.
*   Binary challenges for platforms of that time.

**Use them to:**
*   Understand the history and evolution of cybersecurity threats.
*   See how foundational concepts that are still relevant today were presented over a decade ago.
*   Enjoy a nostalgic trip down memory lane!
